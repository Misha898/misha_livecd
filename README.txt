Hi!

/*
   void todo(void) {
        printf("misha_livecd");
   }
*/

This is one of my projects for learning operating systems.
Live-cd image builder
Project name - /* todo();  */ ( 'cause the word is built accordingly to C lang )

Use scripts build_iso and run_iso in ./scripts/ directory
for building and running image correspondingly

Any contributions are welcome!
